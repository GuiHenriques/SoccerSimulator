## Description:
This is a web-based application using JavaScript, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Jinja to simulate soccer matches. 

The user can choose between European, Brazilian, and International teams, simulate tournaments, and analyze the results. The user can also create their own teams and simulate matches between them.

## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  flask run
```
## Code Description:

I'm using SQLite3, a lightweight and versatile database management system, to store teams name, ratings, color and others.

I'm using the Flask module to handle routing and requests and implement logic to interact with the SQLite3 database.

To enhance the visual appeal and responsiveness of the web pages, I have employed the Bootstrap framework.

In addition to HTML and Bootstrap, I have employed JavaScript and CSS to add interactivity and custom styling to the web application

Also, Jinja is used to render the HTML templates with the data from the database.
